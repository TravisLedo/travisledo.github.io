      "After taking my first Java class at a community college, I decided to build my first Java application. I did put it on hold though due to my lack of knowledge at the time. Eventually I came back to finish it during my Junior year when I had free time. This was my first experience with the JavaFX library. I did learn something similar in class called Swing but I heard it was outdated and wanted to learn the modern version of it."

This is a free, intuitive, offline solution to assist them with these tasks. Users have the ability to preview the animations before finalizing their images. It is developed in C++ using QT Creator and works for both MacOS and Windows."
